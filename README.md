# AQI by PM2.5 pollutant in Polish provincial cities, compared to Lublin

This project contains my exercise solution for a basic reproducible research with data tidying process.
`.csv` files contain PM2.5 data taken from GIOÅš for selected provincial cities in Poland.

`rmd.html` is served on a github page.
`script.r` is a script responsible for parsing the `.csv` files and data frames.
`rmd.Rmd` is an `R Markdown` file containing the results of my research.
